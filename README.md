# Hey there! 👋 I'm Akhila

I'm a former **Software Engineer II** with real-world experience in building dynamic web applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **Laravel**, **CodeIgniter**, and **SQL**. After years of developing production-ready software, I'm now pivoting into the world of **modern full-stack developer**.

## 🚀 Transitioning to Full-Stack Developer

Currently, I'm focused on deepening my skills in:

- ⚛️ React & Next.js  
- 🧠 TypeScript & JavaScript (ES6+)  
- 🛠️ Node.js, Express & REST APIs  
- 🧱 SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL  
- 🧩 Frontend architecture, testing, design patterns

I’m actively building personal projects, solving real-world problems, and sharing my journey through code. My GitHub is a reflection of continuous learning and growth 🚀
